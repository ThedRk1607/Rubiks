# Rubiks-cube-Solver
# Modeled a virtual Rubik's Cube(3x3) in three different Models/Classes using different data-structures in c++.
# Achieve a solving time under 3 seconds for a Rubik's Cube jumbled 8 times using BFS, DFS and IDDFS Algorithms.
# Implemented the Korf's IDA* Algorithm, achieving a solving time under 10 seconds for a Rubik's Cube jumbled 13 times.
